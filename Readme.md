# Home assignment - Affilomania

Hi all,

The application that I wrote is written in nodejs with Typescript and express framework

The application contains api that answers the requirements that were given.

To activate that application please do the following steps:

1. yarn
2. npm run dev

**Comments**
I wrote also postman to check the API's. I will attach it to the project.
(The name of the file is: Affilomania.postman_collection.json)

Good luck to all of us
